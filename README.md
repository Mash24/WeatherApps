# Weather Information App

## Description

This Weather Information App is a Java application designed to provide real-time weather updates to users. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, allowing users to input a location and retrieve relevant weather information. The app integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time data, displays weather details for the specified location, and includes features such as unit conversion, error handling, history tracking, dynamic backgrounds, and more.

## Features

### API Integration

- Utilizes a weather API (OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, etc.) to fetch real-time weather data.

### GUI Design

- User-friendly GUI designed using JavaFX.
- Includes components for users to input the location (city name or coordinates).

### Display Weather Information

- Displays relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions for the specified location.

### Icon Representation

- Uses appropriate icons or images to visually represent weather conditions (e.g., sun for clear sky, clouds for cloudy weather).

### Forecast Display

- Implements a section to display a short-term weather forecast for the chosen location.

### Unit Conversion

- Provides an option to switch between different units for temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit) and wind speed.

### Error Handling

- Implements proper error handling for scenarios like invalid location input or failed API requests.

### History Tracking

- Allows users to view a history of their recent weather searches with timestamps.

### Dynamic Backgrounds

- Implements dynamic background changes based on the time of day (e.g., a sunset background in the evening).
